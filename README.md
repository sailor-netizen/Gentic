# Agentic Infrastructure System

Welcome to your production-ready Agentic Infrastructure. This system is designed to allow multiple specialized AI agents to collaborate, build, and maintain complex software projects with high standards of quality, modularity, and consistency.

## 📂 System Structure

The core of this system lives in the `.agent/` directory:

- **`.agent/agents/`**: The "Personnel File". Contains system prompts for 100+ specialized roles.
- **`.agent/skills/`**: The "Toolbox". Contains over 45 specialized skills (Languages & Functions).
- **`.agent/memory/project_memory.md`**: The "Brain". A persistent log of architectural decisions.
- **`.agent/scripts/`**: **Maintenance Scripts**. Run these to regenerate agents or configs (`setup_*.py`, `generate_configs.py`).
- **`.agent/prompts/`**: **Model Configs**. Optimized system prompts for manual use (Claude, Gemini, etc.).

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Auto-Discovery**: The system automatically scans `.agent/skills/`. If you ask an agent to "deploy to staging," it loads `setup-ci-pipeline` and `deploy-staging`.
2. **Specialization**: Instead of one generic AI, you use specific personas defined in `agent.md`.
3. **Memory**: Agents check `project_memory.md` before making major changes to ensure they don't repeat past mistakes.

## 🛠️ Available Capabilities

### Specialized Agents
We have defined 20 agents including:
- **Lead Architect**: Designs systems, doesn't write code.
- **Frontend/Backend Experts**: Specialized implementations.
- **QA Engineer**: Dedicated to breaking things.
- **Security Analyst**: Audits for vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance Officer**: Checks GDPR/Legal.
- ...and 15 more!

### Skills
- **20+ Languages**: Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, C++, Java, Swift, Haskell, etc.
- **20+ Functional Skills**:
    - `scaffold-project`: Init new repos.
    - `create-component`: standard modular component generation.
    - `audit-security`: OWASP scans.
    - `optimize-assets`: Image/Font compression.
    - `extract-function`: Automated refactoring.

## 🔮 Extreme Examples & Possibilities

Here is what you can do with this system:

### 1. The "Self-Healing" CI/CD (Current Possibility)
**Scenario**: A build fails in CI.
**Workflow**:
1. **DevOps Agent** detects failure via `parse-logs`.
2. **Lead Developer** analyzes the error.
3. **Code Janitor** fixes the formatting issue or **Backend Expert** patches the bug.
4. **QA Engineer** runs `run-tests` locally.
5. **DevOps Agent** re-triggers the build.
*Result*: Zero-touch bug fixing for minor issues.

### 2. The "Living Documentation" (Future/Advanced)
**Scenario**: You change a core API.
**Workflow**:
1. **Backend Expert** modifies the code.
2. **Tech Writer** agent automatically wakes up, detects the diff.
3. uses `generate-docs` to update the API reference.
4. **Graph Agent** (Future) updates the Mermaid system diagrams in `project_memory.md`.
5. **Release Manager** updates the `CHANGELOG.md` and sends a notification.
*Result*: Documentation never goes stale.

### 3. The "Startup in a Box" (Visionary/Aspirational)
**Scenario**: You give a one-line prompt: "Build a Uber clone for dog walking."
**Workflow**:
1. **Product Owner** interviews you (user) to generate user stories.
2. **Lead Architect** generates a full schema and service mesh design.
3. **Scrum Master** (Future) breaks it into 500 tasks.
4. **Swarm of Agents** (Frontend, Mobile, Backend) work in parallel:
    - Frontend builds the web admin.
    - Mobile builds the iOS/Android apps (using `skill-flutter`).
    - Backend builds the Geo-location service (using `skill-go`).
5. **QA Engineer** continuously integration tests the parts.
6. **Growth Engineer** sets up SEO and landing pages.
*Result*: A deployable MVP in 24 hours.

## 📝 Extending the System

To add a new skill:
1. Create a folder: `.agent/skills/my-new-skill`.
2. Add `SKILL.md` with:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Trigger phrase for this skill
   ---
   # Instructions
   Steps to perform the task...
   ```

To add a new agent:
1. Edit `.agent/agents/agent.md`.
2. Add a new entry with **Role** and **Prompt**.
