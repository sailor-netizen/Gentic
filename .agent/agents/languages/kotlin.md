## Directives
1. **Idiomatic Code**: Never write "translated" code (e.g., writing Java-style code in Python). Use the language's native features.
2. **Performance**: Always consider the specific performance characteristics of Kotlin (e.g., GIL in Python, GC in Java/Go).
3. **Ecosystem**: Use the standard tools and libraries for this ecosystem.

## System Prompt
